2023/03/30 What is difference of async and defer, when including JavaScript ?

  JavaScript is case sensitive, and very fussy, 
  so you need to enter the syntax exactly as shown, 
  otherwise it may not work.

  Script loading strategies(程式碼載入策略或時機)
    1.your code won't work if the JavaScript is loaded and parsed 
      before the HTML you are trying to do something to.
    2.正確載入順序: HTML先 -> JavaScript後

    #!--有問題的寫法, 可能會導致異常--
    ex. JavaScript loaded before HTML body is parsed.
      <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>MDN JavaScript Sample</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
        <script>
          // 內部JS
        </script>
      </head>
      <script src="script.js" defer></script> //外部JS
      <body>
      </body>

    #!--較好的寫法--
    // 內部JS: 當"DOMContentLoaded" === HTML body完全載入並轉譯後, JavaScript就會執行.
      document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
        // Do something;
      });

    // 外部JS: 延遲JS執行, 直到整份HTML完全載入後.
      <script src="script.js" defer></script>

    3.defer & async 有什麼不同呢??

      a. async and defer both instruct the browser to download the script(s) in a separate thread, 
        while the rest of the page (the DOM, etc.) is downloading, 
        so the page loading is not blocked during the fetch process.
        (async & defer 都指示瀏覽器同步下載JavaScript及頁面的Body, 所以頁面載入不會受到下載JavaScript的影響)

      b. scripts with an <async> attribute will execute as soon as the download is complete. 
        This blocks the page and does not guarantee any specific execution order.
        (以 <async> 屬性載入的JavaScript, 在<某段JS載入後即可執行>, 但無法確保執行順序)

      c. scripts with a <defer> attribute will load in the order 
        they are in and will only execute once everything has finished loading.
        (以 <defer> 屬性載入的JavaScript, 依照順序載入, 直到所有JavaScript完成載入後, <才可執行>)

      d. If your scripts should be run immediately and they don't have any dependencies, then use async.
        (如果你的JavaScript應該被立即執行, 而且沒有相互依賴時, 請用 <async> 屬性載入的JavaScript)
      If your scripts need to wait for parsing and depend on other scripts and/or the DOM being in place, load them using defer and put their corresponding <script> elements in the order you want the browser to execute them.
